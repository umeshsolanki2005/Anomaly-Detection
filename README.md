# Anomaly-Detection
Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify unusual or rare data points that deviate significantly from the normal pattern in a dataset, often indicating critical events such as fraud, defects, or security breaches. It can be performed using **supervised learning**, where labeled anomalies are used for training, or **unsupervised learning**, where patterns are identified without predefined labels. In this task, an **Isolation Forest algorithm** is applied to detect anomalies in a synthetic dataset consisting of two normally distributed features, with artificial anomalies introduced to simulate unusual behavior. The dataset is first standardized using **StandardScaler**, then processed through **Isolation Forest**, which assigns an anomaly score to each data point. Finally, a scatter plot is used to visualize the anomalies, where deviating points are highlighted, demonstrating how this method effectively identifies outliers in data streams.
